## Directions to the Hotel Arabelle:

From Zurich airport, you should have direct connections to Bern by train. There are ticket selling machines on top of the tracks at the airport, and you can take a round trip that we'll reimburse you. The trip to Bern should be about 1h20 from Zurich.

We have booked a hotel near our institute (Arabelle hotel). It is 10' walking distance from the station. Here are some guidelines on how to get there:
1) First, when you exit the train, continue in the forward direction, until you see some escalators going upon an upper transversal platform (cf picture). Do not go down to the main hall of the station as it is then much more difficult and longer to get to your hotel.
2) Once on the platform, go right (North) and take some further escalators going up at its extremity. At this stage you should be on Schanzenstrasse, a street that goes up.
3) So go up on that street, until you reach a plateau (100m) and continue on the same street (now called Langgasse) until the first traffic light (400m) and then turn right on Mittelstrasse, where you'll see the Arabelle hotel 50m on the left hand side.
