# Team

## Claudia Bank

* Principal investigator, Head of Division
* Contact: evoldynamics [at] gmail.com

<i>I study evolution – and in particular, the population genetics of adaptation and speciation – at the interface of theoretical and empirical biology. The approaches I use involve theoretical modeling, computational methods, and statistical data analysis.</i>

<i>I am very interested in evolution in general.
Currently, I am developing models for the way fitness landscapes vary across different environments. Before joining the Evolutionary Dynamics group, I investigated the role tradeoffs play in evolution.</i>

## Juan Li
 
* Postdoctoral fellow

<i>I am interested in speciation and polygenic traits evolution in general. Currently, I am working on detecting hybrid incompatibilities in population genomes, and also on the question how standing variation contribute the population adaptation under a sudden selection.</i>

<i>I study models of mutation and selection, especially analytical solutions to mechanisms of adaptation, e.g. for the probabilities of evolutionary rescue in mutational meltdown. This can help us to better understand how viruses may escape the effects of mutagenic drugs.</i>

## Ana Y. Morales-Arce
 
* Postdoctoral fellow
* Contact: aymorales [at] igc.gulbenkian.pt, [web-site](http://aymorales-arce.com)

<i>I use experimental evolution in combination with simulations to understand the adaptation of the Influenza A virus to mutagenic drugs. My research explores the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in shaping pathogen variation and evolution, including progeny skew, infection dynamics, as well as direct and linked selection effects.</i>

## Loïc Marrec
 
* Postdoctoral fellow
* Contact: loic.marrec [at] iee.unibe.ch

<i>My general interest is in theoretical evolution and population genetics. My aim is to understand how evolutionary and ecological dynamics shape microbial communities. More specifically, I study the biodiversity and stability of these communities using analytical methods and stochastic simulations, as well as data.</i>

## Ana-Hermina Ghenu

* PhD student (co-supervised by Isabel Gordo)
* Contact: ahghenu [at] igc.gulbenkian.pt

![Photo of Ana-Hermina Ghenu](/assets/img/team/hermina_ghenu_320x320.jpg)
<i>My general interest is in understanding how evolutionary processes shape genomes. I am particularly fascinated by the selective forces that different environments exert on a given genome. My Ph.D. research integrates fitness landscapes theory with bacterial experimental evolution in order to understand antibiotic resistance across environments.</i>

## Marco Louro
 
* PhD student (co-supervised by Mónica Bettencourt Dias)
* Contact: mlouro [at] igc.gulbenkian.pt

<i>I am studying  the evolution of centrosome numbers in cancer progression and their exact contribution to chromosome missegregation and genomic instability. The centrosome is a central player in cell division, promoting proper chromosome segregation through organization of the mitotic spindle. In cancer, centrosomes are often found in abnormally high numbers.</i>

## Adamandia Kapopoulou

* Bioinformatician
* Contact: adamantia.kapopoulou [at] iee.unibe.ch

<i>My background is both genetics and bioinformatics, and I am interested about genomics in general. In the past, I have been working mainly with NGS datasets focusing on cancer genomics, epigenetics, demography, and the evolution of transcription factors and endogenous retroviruses. I am currently working on human Ancient DNA and population genetics of bacterial communities.</i>

# Associated members

## Massimo Amicone
 
* Associated PhD student ([Gordo lab](http://eao.igc.gulbenkian.pt/EVB/index.html))
* Contact: mamicone [at] igc.gulbenkian.pt

![Photo of Massimo Amicone](/assets/img/team/massimo_amicone_320x320.jpg)
<i>I’m generally interested in the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. My current goal is to understand how eco-evolutionary dynamics can shape the diversity of microbial communities. Inspired by empirical observations, I build ecology-driven models of adaptation to generate new hypotheses regarding the evolution of bacteria within the gut microbiota and to answer general questions about biodiversity.</i>
