### empiricIST: a software that allows for accurate estimation of selection coefficients and credibility intervals from bulk competitions

[empiricIST](https://github.com/Matu2083/empiricIST) is an integrative framework for the analysis of bulk competition data, and includes separate programs for processing raw sequence data and correcting for sequencing errors, obtaining statistically meaningful estimates of selection coefficients in a fast and efficient manner, and for providing ready-to-use summary statistics of the MCMC analysis and its associated parameter estimates.

Also check out our manuscript on [The fitness landscape of the codon space across environments](https://doi.org/10.1101/252395) to see an example of how empiricIST can be used. We used the selection coefficients estimates to quantify changes in the topology and the topography of the codon fitness landscape in different environments considering non-synonymous and synonymous mutations.
