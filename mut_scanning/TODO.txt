(This list is somewhat prioritized)

Easy tasks:
*DONE* add a timestamp on the bottom to indicate when tool was last updated *DONE*
*DONE* Add some more options for # Time Points (tau). Maybe up to 12 *DONE*
*DONE* should create error messages for text boxes on calculate costs page (Now if you enter in a non-numeric value you get NaN in the monetary costs section. Should be an error message) *DONE*
*DONE* change horizontal size of tool such that it's NOT defined in terms of px (the way it's done now is sloppy and means that tool may look bad on different devices) *DONE*
*DONE* add document padding so that the tool is centered and the text on top doesn't look horrible *DONE*
*DONE* add a footer to the document where the page last updated can appear. -->A bit sloppy, but *DONE*

Moderate tasks:
-calculations should be executed instantly when the user leaves a text box (i.e. no need for "Calculate!" buttons)
-yes/no toggle button on calculate costs page looks horrible. Change size and colour
-When the MSE becomes very small the numbers (under 'Unequally spaced time points' only) collide with the axis label
-should clean up code to use jQuery when appropriate, etc.

Difficult tasks:
-speed up the calculations so that there is no/less lag on the visualization page when sliders are moved around
-should be able to control sliders and calculations by inputting a value in what is now the place where the slider value is outputted (It's too hard for user to select a specific/precise value)
-create slider with adjustable number of handles for inputting the unequal time points
