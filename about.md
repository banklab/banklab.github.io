## Claudia Bank

* Principal investigator, Head of Division
* Contact: evoldynamics [at] gmail.com

<i>I study evolution – and in particular, the population genetics of adaptation and speciation – at the interface of theoretical and empirical biology. The approaches I use involve theoretical modeling, computational methods, and statistical data analysis.</i>

## André Amado

* Postdoctoral fellow
* Contact: aamado [at] igc.gulbenkian.pt

<i>I am very interested in evolution in general.
Currently, I am developing models for the way fitness landscapes vary across different environments. Before joining the Evolutionary Dynamics group, I investigated the role tradeoffs play in evolution.</i>

## Juan Li
 
* Postdoctoral fellow
* Contact: lijuan2010big [at] gmail.com

<i>I am interested in speciation and polygenic traits evolution in general. During my PhD, I studied on the genetic basis of mating behavior isolation and how the regulatory duplications evolved in Drosophila melanogaster. Currently, I am working on detecting hybrid incompatibilities in population genomes, and also on the question how standing variation contribute the population adaptation under a sudden selection.</i>

<i>I study models of mutation and selection, especially analytical solutions to mechanisms of adaptation, e.g. for the probabilities of evolutionary rescue in mutational meltdown. This can help us to better understand how viruses may escape the effects of mutagenic drugs.</i>

## Ana Y. Morales-Arce
 
* Postdoctoral fellow
* Contact: aymorales [at] igc.gulbenkian.pt, [web-site](http://aymorales-arce.com)

<i>I am use experimental evolution in combination with simulations to understand the adaptation of Influenza A virus  to mutagenic drugs. My research explores the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in shaping pathogen variation and evolution, including progeny skew, infection dynamics, as well as direct and linked selection effects.</i>

## Ana-Hermina Ghenu

* PhD student (co-supervised by Isabel Gordo)
* Contact: hermina.ghenu [at] gmail.com

![](/assets/img/hermina_ghenu_320x320.jpg)
<i>My general interest is in understanding how evolutionary processes shape genomes. I am particularly fascinated by the selective forces that different environments exert on a given genome. My Ph.D. research integrates fitness landscapes theory with bacterial experimental evolution in order to understand antibiotic resistance across environments.</i>
