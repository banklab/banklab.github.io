# Welcome !

Welcome to the web page of the Bank lab at the [University of Bern](http://www.thee.iee.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) and the [Gulbenkian Institute](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/research-groups/cbank/).

## Theoretical Ecology and Evolution

In the Division of Theoretical Ecology and Evolution, we use theoretical and statistical approaches to quantify evolutionary processes. With projects ranging across all levels of biological organisation, we address questions about adaptation and speciation.
